# FirstNN

This is a simple feed forward neural network trained to identify malignant/benign tumors from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Set. Install the packages and run firstNN(upgraded) to train the neural network. It will then be saved into best_model_basic or best_model_upgraded. Run importednn to test saved neural networks.
